# Mandelbrot-and-Julia-sets

The Mandelbrot set is the set of all c for which the iteration z â†’ z2 + c, starting from z = 0, does not diverge to infinity. Julia sets are either connected (one piece) or a dust of infinitely many points. The Mandelbrot set is those c for which the Julia set is connected.
